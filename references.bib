  abstract  = {This chapter develops comprehensive discussion on MEMS (MicroElectroMechanical-Systems) technologies. First, the inception of the concept of microsystems is analysed with reference to the evolution of semiconductor technologies, highlighting common features as well as their differentiation. The most common technology platforms for microsystems manufacturing are reported. Examples of consolidated (market) exploitations of MEMS sensors and actuators are also provided. Then, RF-MEMS, i.e. MEMS for Radio Frequency passives, are introduced, explaining their working principles and listing diverse actuation mechanisms. Subsequently, the most common categories of RF-MEMS devices are introduced, focusing both on simple components, as well as on complex high-order reconfigurable networks.},
